# Just List 🛒  
**A Budget Tracking App**  

Just List is a mobile application designed to help users organize and track their shopping budgets. This app was born out of the need for a simple and user-friendly solution to manage supermarket shopping lists and costs, especially during times of price increases.

## 🧾 Project Overview  
I often struggled with managing my shopping budgets, particularly at the supermarket. To better plan my purchases, I started noting down the products I intended to buy and their prices. After trying several apps, I realized none met my needs for simplicity and user-friendly design. As a beginner in Flutter, I decided to develop **Just List** as a daily tool for myself. The app is straightforward yet fulfills its purpose perfectly.  

**Current Status:**  
The app is fully functional and available on **Google Play**.
